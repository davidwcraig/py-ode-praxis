For integrating differential equations with python, numpy, etc.

## Learning how to integrate with Python

This is a practice repository I have set up for Python code, etc.
It has two main purposes:
- To learn how to use Git;
- to learn how to use GitHub;
- to write some physics-oriented numerical Python code.
